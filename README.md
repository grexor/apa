## About

apa is a Python framework for processing and analysing 3'-end targeted sequence data to study alternative polyadenylation. [apa](https://github.com/grexor/apa) depends on [pybio](https://github.com/grexor/pybio) (basic handling of annotated genomes), [RNAmotifs2](https://github.com/grexor/rnamotifs2) (analysis of regulatory motif clusters) and other open-source software (DEXSeq, STAR short-read aligner).

The inclusive nature of the framework, together with novel integrative solutions (differential polyA site usage and RNA-protein binding via RNA-maps, cluster motif analysis), results in the following computational capabilities:

+ management of diverse high-throughput sequencing datasets (pre-processing, alignment, annotation),
+ polyA site database (atlas) construction and comparison to existing polyA resources,
+ identification of genes that undergo alternative polyadenylation (DEXSeq),
+ identification of motifs influencing polyA site choice (RNAmotifs2),
+ identification of motifs influencing alternative splicing (DEXSeq and RNAmotifs2),
+ integration with iCLIP (RNA-protein binding) and computing RNA-maps,
+ and other.

## Run with Docker

Since this python package has several dependencies (`pybio` for genome download and manupulation, for example), the easiest way to try out the package with an example dataset is by running the docker image (provided with the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)).

### Build the Docker image

Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/grexor/apa.git`) and run `build.sh` to build the Docker image (you need to have Docker installed).

This will build a Docker image with *apa*, *pybio* and all other dependencies installed. It will also create a "data" folder on your local drive (inside the same folder where `build.sh` is) where larger genome and result files will be stored. You can change the location of the data folder by modifying the `build.sh` script.

To login to the system (user *apauser*), simply run the `run_apauser.sh` script. You are now running the Docker container with all required dependencies and software to run the `apa` example provided.

### Example dataset

To directly start the example processing, follow brief instructions in [Running the example](#running-the-example).

We provide an example [Lexogen Quantseq Reverse](https://www.lexogen.com/quantseq-3mrna-sequencing-rev/) sequencing run consisting of 6 experiments (3 HEK293, 3 TDP-43 KD) from the publication:

[High-resolution RNA maps suggest common principles of splicing and polyadenylation regulation by TDP-43](http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247(17)30522-3)<br />

In total 6 FASTQ files. The reads will be downloaded and processed in the Docker container by the `docker/example.sh` script. Reads for the example were preselected to match only the ones mapping to the chr22 of the hg38 assembly.

#### Data folder organization and structure

Data is organized inside **libraries**. Each library contains several experiments. Each experiment is represented by a FASTQ file. The sequencing (library) data is stored in the `apa.path.data_folder`. The location of the data folder can be changed by editing `apa/config/config.txt` and adding a line with `apa.path.data_folder="/path/to/data_folder"`.

```
# structure the data folder on apa

->data_folder [folder]
  ->example [folder] # folder of sequencing library with id example
    ->annotation.tab [file] # annotation TAB separated file (see below for structure)
    ->example.config # config file for the entire library (see below for structure)
    ->e1 [folder] # experiment 1
      ->example_e1.fastq.gz [file] # FASTQ file of experiment 1
      ->m1 [folder] # mapping 1, usually, we only map each experiment once, however several mappings (diverse parameters) can be addded (m1, m2, ...)
    ->e2 [folder] # experiment 2
      ->example_e2.fastq.gz [file] # FASTQ file of experiment 2
  ->example2 [folder] # folder of sequencing library with id example2
  ->example3 [folder] # folder of sequencing library with id example3
  ...
```
##### Library annotation file

The `annotation.tab` file is present for each library (always with the same name) and annotates the experiments within the library. It's a TAB separated file with the following structure:

```
# first line is always a comment
exp_id	species	map_to	method	condition	replicate
1	hg38chr22	hg38chr22	lexrev	HEK293	1
2	hg38chr22	hg38chr22	lexrev	HEK293	2
3	hg38chr22	hg38chr22	lexrev	HEK293	3
4	hg38chr22	hg38chr22	lexrev	KD	1
5	hg38chr22	hg38chr22	lexrev	KD	2
6	hg38chr22	hg38chr22	lexrev	KD	3
```

Each line represents an experiment.

```
exp_id = experiment id (integer number)
species = species, descriptive (human, mouse, ms, hg, etc.)
map_to = id of genome (linked to pybio package) for read mapping
method = id of method
condition = descriptive
replicate = descriptive
```

##### Library config file

The library config file is named with `libraryid.config`. In our example, since our library has id `example`, the file is `example.config`. The minimum structure of the library config file is as follows:

```
name:HEK-239
notes:Library with 3'-end Lexogen Quantrev sequencing of HEK-293 cell lines
method:lexrev
genome:hg38chr22
map_to:hg38chr22
seq_type:single
tags:
status:
columns:[['Condition', 'condition'], ['Replicate', 'replicate']]
columns_display:[['Condition', 'condition'], ['Replicate', 'replicate']]
```

#### Comparative analysis

Using DEXSeq, we can identify APA genes by comparing sets of control vs. test experiments. The comparisons are stored in the `apa.path.comps_folder`, each comparison is defined by the config file.

Structure of the comparison data folder is:

```
->comps_folder [folder]
  ->example [folder] # folder of the comparison with id example
    ->example.config [file] # config file of the comparison
    ->example.pairs_de.tab [file] # TAB file with results, one line per gene, regulated and control pairs of polyA sites
```

We run the comparative analysis with `apa.comps -comps_id example` (for the example provided).

##### Comparison config file

TAB separated file:

```
id	experiments	name
c1	example_e1	HEK293_1
c2	example_e2	HEK293_2
c3	example_e3	HEK293_3
t1	example_e4	KD_1
t2	example_e5	KD_2
t3	example_e6	KD_3

control_name:HEK293
test_name:KD
site_selection:DEX
polya_db:example
poly_type:["strong"]

# at least half of the experiments at a specific polyA site need to count at least 5 reads
presence_thr:2.0
cDNA_thr:5

analysis_type:apa
method:lexrev
genome:hg38chr22
```

In the example above, 3 control and 3 test experiments, all coming from library `example`.

#### Running the example

To run the provided example, start `~/apa/docker/example.sh` inside the Docker container. This will download the chr22 of the hg38 genome assembly, download and map the 6 example experiments (3 HEK293 and 3 TDP-43 KD) to the hg38 genome (only chromosome 22). It will build a polyA database from the aligned reads, estimate read counts at the identified polyA sites and also provide gene expression.

Content of `docker/example.sh`:
```
# map all library experiments with STAR
apa.map.lib -lib_id example

# create BED files from mapped reads according to protocol
apa.bed.multi -lib_id example

# make configuration file for polyA database (includes all experiments in the library)
apa.polya.makeconfig -lib_id example

# create polyA database
apa.polya -poly_id example

# compute gene expression using htseq-count
apa.bed.gene_expression -lib_id example

# compute polyA site counts according to provided mapping and polyA database
apa.bed.multi -lib_id example -type expression -poly_id example -upstream 10 -downstream 10

# compute comparative analysis
apa.comps -comps_id example
```

## Run with expressRNA

Since the setup and analysis of data with this package can be time consuming, we developed an interactive online platform [expressRNA](https://expressRNA.org). You can upload your experiment FASTQ files, annotate and perform analysis on the expressRNA server if desired.

## Authors

[apa](https://github.com/grexor/apa) is developed and supported by [Gregor Rot](https://grexor.github.io) in collaboration with several research laboratories worldwide.

The development started in 2009 when Toma≈æ Curk and Gregor Rot wrote the first prototype of [apa](https://github.com/grexor/apa). In 2013, Gregor Rot refactored and further developed the code, also establishing [expressRNA](http://expressRNA.org), a web application for exploring results of alternative polyadenylation analysis.
