# apa: alternative polyadenylation (APA) analysis

apa is a Python framework for processing and analysing 3'-end targeted sequence data to study alternative polyadenylation. [apa](https://github.com/grexor/apa) interconnects [pybio](https://github.com/grexor/pybio) (basic handling of annotated genomes), [RNAmotifs2](https://github.com/grexor/rnamotifs2) (analysis of regulatory motif clusters) and other open-source software (DEXSeq, STAR short-read aligner).

The inclusive nature of the framework, together with novel integrative solutions (differential polyA site usage and RNA-protein binding via RNA-maps, cluster motif analysis), results in the following computational capabilities:

+ management of diverse high-throughput sequencing datasets (pre-processing, alignment, annotation),
+ polyA site database (atlas) construction and comparison to existing polyA resources,
+ identification of genes that undergo alternative polyadenylation (DEXSeq),
+ identification of motifs influencing polyA site choice (RNAmotifs2),
+ identification of motifs influencing alternative splicing (DEXSeq and RNAmotifs2),
+ integration with iCLIP (RNA-protein binding) and computing RNA-maps,
+ and other.

## Authors

[apa](https://github.com/grexor/apa) is developed and supported by [Gregor Rot](https://grexor.github.io) in collaboration with several research laboratories worldwide.

The development started in 2009 when Tomaž Curk and Gregor Rot wrote the first prototype of [apa](https://github.com/grexor/apa). In 2013, Gregor Rot refactored and further developed the code, also establishing [expressRNA](http://expressRNA.org), a web application for exploring results of alternative polyadenylation analysis.
